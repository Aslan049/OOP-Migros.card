# Migros Shopping Application

This project is a simple shopping application that simulates transactions and applies discounts based on customer card status.

## Features

- **Customer Management**: Represents a customer and calculates payments with or without a money card.
- **Discount Application**: Applies a discount if the customer has a money card.
- **Product Handling**: Manages product details and calculates total prices.

## Files

- **`migrosBase.js`**: Contains the base functionality for payment calculations.
- **`customer.js`**: Extends `MigrosBase` to add customer-specific features.
- **`main.js`**: Manages user interactions and processes transactions.

## How It Works

The application prompts users about their money card status, collects their details, and calculates the total price and payment amount based on their card status and selected products.
